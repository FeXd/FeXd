## 👨‍🏫 Tips for Students
If you aren't a student, keep scrolling.

 1. **ask for help**, be kind to yourself
 2. use dev tools, always **read your console**, and check your inspector
 3. git **commit early** and often, commit messages longer your code are ok
 4. good **communication** is more important than most things
